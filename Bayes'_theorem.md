### Bayes' theorem
Describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

### Bayes' inference
* One of the many applications of Bayes' theorem is Bayesian inference.  
* Bayesian inference is fundamental to Bayesian statistics.

* P ( A | B ) is a conditional probability: the probability of event A occurring given that B is true.   
  **posterior probability of A given B.**
* P ( B ∣ A ) is also a conditional probability: the probability of event B occurring given that A is true.   
  **the likelihood of A given a fixed B because P ( B ∣ A ) = L ( A ∣ B ).**
* P ( A ) and P ( B ) are the probabilities of observing A and B respectively without any given conditions;  
  **the marginal probability or prior probability.**
* A and B must be different events.

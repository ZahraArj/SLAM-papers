##VAE
  - The basic idea behind the VAE proposed by Kingma et al in 2013 is that instead of mapping an input to a fixed vector, the input is mapped to a distribution.
  - The only fundamental difference between an autoencoder and a variational autoencoder is that the bottleneck of the VAE is continuous and replaced by two separate vectors.

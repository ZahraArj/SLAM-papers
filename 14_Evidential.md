* T Distribution: similar to the normal distribution with its bell shape but has heavier tails. T distributions have a greater chance for extreme values than normal distributions, hence the fatter tails. 

## Learning the evidential distribution
1. As a way of fitting our data to the evidential model while 
2. Enforces a prior to remove incorrect evidence and inflate uncertainty.

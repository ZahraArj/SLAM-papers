## 1. Feature Point Extraction
- Dividing each scan it into four identical sub-regions. 
- A sub-region is a subset of points of each scan. 
- The LOAM feature extractor is responsible for classifying each point of all sub-regions as smooth (flat) or non-smooth (sharp) according to a threshold. 
- This threshold is represented by CLOAM and it is defined as:

- R is the set of points from a sub-region of a scan (RâŠ‚Pk). 
- p(i,k) and p(j,k) represent the ith and jth point vectors of the sweep k of R. 
- || ||represents the L2 norm.

* selecting feature points
* unreliable: 
    * avoid points whose surrounded points are selected
    * points on local planar surfaces that are roughly parallel to the laser beams (point B in Fig. 4(a))
    * points that are on boundary of occluded regions

## 1. Feature Point Extraction
- Dividing each scan it into four identical sub-regions. 
- A sub-region is a subset of points of each scan. 
- The LOAM feature extractor is responsible for classifying each point of all sub-regions as smooth (flat) or non-smooth (sharp) according to a threshold. 
- This threshold is represented by CLOAM and it is defined as:

- Ris the set of points from a sub-region of a scan (RâŠ‚Pk). 
- p(i,k) and p(j,k) represent the ith and jth point vectors of the sweep k of R. 
- || ||represents the L2 norm.

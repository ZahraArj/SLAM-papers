## [Laser-visual-inertial Odometry and Mapping with High Robustness and Low Drift](file:///tmp/mozilla_zara0/JFR2018.pdf)

* Different from traditional methods that use a Kalman filter or factor‚Äêgraph optimization.
* Sequential, multilayer processing pipeline, solving for motion from coarse to fine.

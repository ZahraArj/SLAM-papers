1- [Visual Place Recognition using LiDAR Intensity Information](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/digiammarino2021iros.pdf) 
* Through a cylindrical projection, we can turn  3D LiDAR data information into a 360â—¦panoramic range image. As a result, we can apply techniques from visual place recognition to LiDAR intensity data. 
* This paper provides an analysis of how such visual techniques can be with LiDAR data.
* They provide an evaluation on different datasets. 
* They results suggest that this form of place recognition is possible and an effective means for determining loop closures.  
  
2- [F-LOAM: Fast LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00822.pdf)  
* Solution to robotic applications with limited computational resources.
* They adopt a non-iterative two-stage distortion compensation method to reduce the computational cost of scan-to-scan match and scan-to-map refinement iterative calculation.
* For each scan input, the edge and planar features are extracted and matched to a local edge map and a local plane map separately, where the local smoothness is also considered for iterative pose optimization.
* Method:  
  - we can firstly assume constant angular velocity and linear velocity during short period to predict the motion and correct the distortion.

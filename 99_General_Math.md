## [Exponential map](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/999515/meaning-of-exponential-map)
   The idea of an exponential is the continuous compounding of small actions.

## [SE(3)](https://rock-learning.github.io/pytransform3d/transformations.html)
   The group of all transformations in the 3D Cartesian space is SE(3) (SE: Special Euclidean group). Transformations consist of a rotation and a translation. Those can be represented in different ways just like rotations can be expressed in different ways.  
   All transformation matrices form the special Euclidean group SE(3).

 ## Exponential Coordinates  
    Any transformation (rotation and translation) can be expressed by a motion along a screw axis.

### Challenges, of using DNN for GNSS:
1. Poor numerical conditioning caused by large variations in measurements and position values across the globe.   
2. Varying number and order within the set of measurements due to changing satellite visibility  
3. Overfitting to available data.  

### BACKGROUND: DEEP LEARNING ON SETS:
These inputs of varying size and order are commonly referred to as "set-valued inputs"
